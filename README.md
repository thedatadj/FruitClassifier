# Binary fruit classification
In this project I used a KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn to classify fruits into "orange" or not "orange".

## What I learned
- To perform a hyperparameter search.
- To visualize the "True" and predicted output for comparison.
- Use a KNeighborsClassifier for a binary classification problem.
