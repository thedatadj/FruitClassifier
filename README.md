# FruitClassifier
In this project I used a machine learning model to solve a classification problem of predicting fruit type based on a number of features.


## What I learned:

* To reduce underfitting in a machine learning model.
* To normalize the input features.

## How I did it:

- Preprocessing: I normalized the input features.
    - I used `MinMaxScaler` to scaled the features.
- Model: I used a `KNeighborsClassifier`
- Parameters: 
  - I used a `n_neighbors` = 5
