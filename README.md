# FruitClassifier
In this project I used a machine learning model to predict the type of fruit based on certain features.


## What I learned:

* To reduce underfitting in a machine learning model.
* To perform preprocessing.
* To scaled the input features.

# Description

- Model: KNeighborsClassifier
- Hyperparameters:
  - n_neighbors = 5
