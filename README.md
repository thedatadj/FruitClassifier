# FruitClassifier
In this project I used a machine learning model to predict the type of fruit based on certain features.


## What I learned:

* To reduce underfitting in a machine learning model.
* To perform preprocessing.
* To scaled the input features.

## How I did it:

- Model: I used a KNeighborsClassifier
- Parameters: 
  - I used a `n_neighbors` = 5
- Preprocessing: I used `MinMaxScaler`
